<div> <p>Many homes in Perth still rely on outdated switchboards that struggle with today's appliance usage. Old fuse boxes, originally built to handle basic needs like lighting, a refrigerator, and a stove, aren't equipped to support the wide range of devices used in most households now. Today, a typical family might have multiple TVs, phones, computers, air-conditioning, and even EV chargers or pool pumps. This increase in demand can quickly overwhelm an outdated switchboard, potentially leading to issues like blown fuses or even fire risks. In addition, older switchboards often contain asbestos, a hazardous material that should be professionally removed to protect your health.</p><p>Customer satisfaction remains a cornerstone of In Effect Electrical's business philosophy. They take pride in offering transparent pricing, free quotes, and no-hidden-costs policies. Clients are always fully informed about the costs associated with any electrical work, and the company strives to ensure that all pricing is competitive and fair. Their customer-first approach means that they are always available to answer questions, provide advice, and walk clients through the electrical processes, ensuring that there are no surprises along the way.</p><p>Lighting is an essential part of any kitchen, and our team designs solutions that combine function and style. Task lighting is essential for focused activities like cooking, chopping, or cleaning. Our installations provide direct, bright lighting for areas that need clarity, reducing eye strain and enhancing safety. We also create warm and welcoming ambient lighting with recessed fixtures or pendants, filling the entire room with balanced light. For a more sophisticated look, accent lighting can highlight key architectural features or even become a feature itself with decorative pendants or fixtures, adding elegance to your kitchen.</p></div>
